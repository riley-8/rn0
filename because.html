            <h2>Frankly <span>I</span> have always believed in you—not just in your dreams, but in the fire that drives you, in the way your heart beats for something greater. And if there’s one thing I know, it’s that I would stand beside you through it all, not just as a friend in the distance,<img src="images/heart.png" alt=""> but as the one who holds you steady when the weight of the world feels heavy. Because loving you has never been about mere moments...it’s been about the endless depths of who you are, about seeing you rise, about cherishing every piece of the path <span>YOU</span> walk. And maybe, just maybe, somewhere along that path, we find our spark again.</h2>
